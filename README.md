Browser extension for UBC course registration page to let students access Rate My Prof info easier

Note: **Please be aware that ratings tend to be [flawed and biased](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-014-9313-4).** It is encouraged to keep that in mind and take info presented with a grain of salt rather than using it as the only metric to decide which course to take.

## Demo

## Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable Developer Mode via a toggle
4. Unpack the extension by selecting the cloned dir

## Why?

A typical workflow of a UBC student when registering a course is:
1. Open one of the sections in a new tab
2. Copy the professor name
3. Paste it into Rate My Prof (RMP) search box
4. Review ratings
5. Decide to add the course or not to the schedule
6. Repeat

Searching for RMP info gets time consuming real fast.

This extension hopes to make course registration less stressful than it already is
